# Timeouts

All Modal Function executions have a default execution timeout of 300 seconds
(5 minutes), but users may specify timeout durations between 10 seconds and 24
hours.

    
    
    import time
    
    
    @app.function()
    def f():
        time.sleep(599)  # Timeout!
    
    
    @app.function(timeout=600)
    def g():
        time.sleep(599)
        print("*Just* made it!")

The timeout duration is a measure of a Functionâ€™s _execution_ time. It does
not include scheduling time or any other period besides the time your code is
executing in Modal. This duration is also per execution attempt, meaning
Functions configured with `modal.Retries` will start new execution timeouts on
each retry. For example, an infinite-looping Function with a 100 second
timeout and 3 allowed retries will run for least 400 seconds within Modal.

## Handling timeouts

After exhausting any specified retries, a timeout in a Function will produce a
`modal.exception.FunctionTimeoutError` which you may catch in your code.

    
    
    import modal.exception
    
    
    @app.function(timeout=100)
    def f():
        time.sleep(200)  # Timeout!
    
    
    @app.local_entrypoint()
    def main():
        try:
            f.remote()
        except modal.exception.FunctionTimeoutError:
            ... # Handle the timeout.

## Timeout accuracy

Functions will run for _at least_ as long as their timeout allows, but they
may run a handful of seconds longer. If you require accurate and precise
timeout durations on your Function executions, it is recommended that you
implement timeout logic in your user code.
