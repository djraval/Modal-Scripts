# Modal user account setup

To run and deploy applications on Modal you’ll need to sign up and create a
user account.

You can visit the signup page to begin the process or execute `modal setup` on
the command line.

Users can also be provisioned through Okta SSO, which is an enterprise feature
that you can request. For the typical user you’ll sign-up using an existing
GitHub account. If you’re interested in authenticating with other identity
providers let us know at support@modal.com.

## What GitHub permissions does signing up require?

  * `user:email` — gives us the emails associated with the GitHub account.
  * `read:org` (invites only) — needed for Modal workspace invites. Note: this only allows us to see what organization memberships you have (GitHub docs). We won’t be able to access any code repositories or other details.

## How can I change my email?

You can change your email on the settings page.
